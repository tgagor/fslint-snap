FSlint GUI
==========

This repo provides SNAP packages available as `fslint-unofficial` for [`fslint`](https://github.com/pixelb/fslint) GUI tool.

Tool is pretty useful for finding file duplicates and performing other bath processing on big sets of files.
I love it, but sadly it's not longer available in Ubuntu 20.04 because of lack of Python 2.x support. I know it should be properly updated, but getting it working like that was just good enough for me ;)
